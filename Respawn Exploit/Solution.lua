   This is a critical issue due to people being able to respawn every player, and they could do it on a loop, which breaks and ruins an entire server.

   Update: 1/3/2026
   This happens because you are passing in a player to respawn, when the player is already passed in by default by ROBLOX.

   You need to update your server code for BeingMyself.RemoteEvent.Script
]]

local playerGui = game.Players.LocalPlayer.PlayerGui
local remoteEvent = playerGui.MainMenuGui.CharactersFrame.TextButton.BeingMyself.RemoteEvent

-- Server-side:

-- Before
remoteEvent.OnServerEvent:Connect(function(player, playerRespawn)
    playerRespawn:LoadCharacter()
end)

-- After
remoteEvent.OnServerEvent:Connect(function(player)
    player:LoadCharacter()
end)
