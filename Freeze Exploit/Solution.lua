-- Quick and easy solution.

--[[
  You should update the script that handles the "AnimEvent" on the server. I will provide an example with the checks you need.
]]

local Character = script.Parent.Parent -- Wherever script is located try and find the character.
local Player = game.Players:GetPlayerFromCharacter(Character) -- Find the player first
local animEvent = Character.AnimEvent

animEvent.OnServerEvent:Connect(function(_player, animationId1, animationId2)
    --[[
       Exploiters will fire this event in a players character with no arguments, causing them to freeze. This stops that completely, by checking if they're actually the player that owns the AnimEvent in their character.
       Make sure to check if both animationId1 and animationId2 exist.
    ]]
    if _player.UserId == Player.UserId and animationId1 and animationId2 then -- This is the main part of the solution (see above)
        --  Do animation logic here
    elseif _player.UserId ~= Player.UserId then
        _player:Kick("Not player")
    end
end)
